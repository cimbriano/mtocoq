Issues/Difficulties/Notes

- Duplication in definitions, lemmas, proofs for traces and trace patterns

- Choosing to represent trace equivalence and trace pattern equivalence as Relations instead of functions (because they're only used in a relational way)

- Handling of arrays
	* Will this constrain extending the type system to allow each element of an array to occupy its own OramBank?
